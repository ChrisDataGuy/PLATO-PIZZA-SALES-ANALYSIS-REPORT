## Introduction
This is a Power BI project on sales analysis of an imaginary store PLATO’S PIZZA STORES. Things are going well at Plato's, but there's room for improvement. They  have been collecting transactional data for the  year -2015, but really haven't been able to put it to good use. They look forward to an analysis of the data and a report to help them find opportunities to drive more sales and work more efficiently.

## Statement of the Problem
The manager of Plato’s pizza – Mr. Mario Maven hopes to use the data provided to answer the following questions:
- How much money did we make this year? Can we identify any seasonality in the sales?
- What's our average order value?
- What days and times do we tend to be busiest?
- What are our best and worst selling pizzas?
